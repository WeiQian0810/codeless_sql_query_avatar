# talking_avatar-main
An AI-powered avatar that translates natural language questions into SQL queries to retrieve relevant data from a database. This project bridges the gap between users and data by enabling intuitive, conversational access to structured informationâ€”no coding required.

Add Chat GPT to the mix and maybe you can have for yourself a nice face to chat with. ðŸ™‚


## Run
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Backend
You'll also need https://github.com/WeiQian0810/talking_avatar_backend-main for the text to speech conversion.
